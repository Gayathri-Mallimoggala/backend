### **Key Features**
- ‚úÖ **User Authentication** (Register/Login with JWT)
- ‚úÖ **Customer Management** (Add, Retrieve, Bulk Upload Customers)
- ‚úÖ **Payment Processing** (Record Payments)
- ‚úÖ **Automated Notifications** (Overdue Payment Alerts)
- ‚úÖ **Swagger API Documentation** (`/api-docs`)
- ‚úÖ **WebSockets Integration** (For real-time notifications)
- ‚úÖ **Docker Support** (For containerized deployment)

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Decisions Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Express.js for API Development
Chosen for its minimal and flexible nature.
Easy integration with middleware like cors, jsonwebtoken, multer, and mysql2.
2Ô∏è‚É£ MySQL for Data Storage
Relational database ensures structured storage of customer and payment data.
Supports transactions for bulk operations (e.g., Excel file uploads).
3Ô∏è‚É£ JWT for Authentication
Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Ensures only authenticated users can access the API.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Multer & xlsx for Bulk Upload
Uses multer to handle file uploads.
Reads Excel sheets using xlsx and inserts data into MySQL.
5Ô∏è‚É£ WebSockets for Real-Time Notifications
Uses ws (WebSockets) to send notifications for overdue payments.
Runs a scheduled job to check overdue payments and send alerts.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Swagger for API Documentation
Provides interactive documentation for testing API endpoints.

üî• Future Improvements
‚úÖ Role-based authentication (Admin & Users)
‚úÖ Email notifications for overdue payments
‚úÖ Caching for faster API responses
‚úÖ Pagination & Filtering for customer lists
‚úÖ GraphQL Support for optimized queries
